To run a Node.js script like the one provided, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Here are the steps to run your Node.js script:

Install Node.js:
Download and install Node.js from the official website if you haven't done so already.

Create a new directory:
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal or command prompt.

Initialize a new Node.js project:
Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project. This will create a package.json file.

npm init -y
Install dependencies:
Install the required dependencies (axios, express) by running the following command:

npm install axios
Create a new file (e.g., app.js) and copy the code into this file.

Run the script:
Run your Node.js script using the following command:

node app.js
Replace app.js with the actual name of your file if you used a different name.

The script will execute, and you should see the output in the terminal. Note that if your script is making HTTP requests to external services, make sure you have internet connectivity and that the services are accessible from your network.

Remember to replace the placeholder data in your script (like the token and language) with your actual credentials and data before running it.

Thanks.
